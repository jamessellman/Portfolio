        <p className="text-center md:text-lg">
          I am Jamie, an enthusiastic and dynamic junior software engineer with
          a solid background working in dynamic operational teams in the
          fast-paced fintech sector. Transitioning from my role as an account
          executive to the world of software engineering, I bring a diverse
          skill set developed over several years of operational experience. I
          offer a unique blend of communication, organisational, and negotiation
          skills alongside technical proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          React, and Python. With a self-taught coding education supplemented by
          formal bootcamp training at General Assembly, I am ready to take the
          next step to further establish my software engineering skills and
          contribute to a forward-thinking, game-changing environment.
